//random path is generated from bottom to top

//player may only move one space at a time

//can only go to square 'touching' it

//can only go forward/diagnal forward

//path is hidden-meaning it doesnt show until square is chosen

//tile turns red or green depending on right choice

//if incorrect, game restarts

//player must memorize path

//once player gets to the other side, congratulations is presented\
