How to play
    1) Each player is to 'drop' a game piece into the slot of the game board. 
    2) Each player only recieves one turn before switching to the other player. 
    3) The goal is to connect four pieces in a row before your opponent does, you may use pieces to block them. 

Next Steps

    2) Include the effect of 'gravity', meaning no free floating pieces, they can only be stacked.
